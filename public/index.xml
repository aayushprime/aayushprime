      <description>Welcome to another one of my interesting findings, where I explore some stuff for fun and profit just fun
A while back I was solving AOC and for a problem (day 13), I had this sort of clever idea of using eval to skip writing a if else ladder. The input file had the following structure
Starting items: 91, 65 Operation: new = old * 13 Test: divisible by 5 If true: throw to monkey 7 If false: throw to monkey 4 I had to parse the file to get all values, but when parsing the second line I thought why not use the python interpretor itself.</description>

      <title>Why does my drive mount as read only?</title>

      <description>Today I tried to write an fstab entry so that my drive would automount on boot.
It went as smoothly as I had hoped (at first).
So, I ran sudo blkid to find the UUID of the drive I wanted to mount and added the entry UUID=288C1E6C8C1E3532 /hdrive auto defaults 0 0 following the steps in this wonderful article. (Some options are different after I realized what I wanted.)

      <title>Google Sheets as Database?</title>

      <description>I recently learned that Google Sheets can be used as a database (although with caveats I hear). And I love it.
It is so much easier to see what is in the spreadsheet than on a sqlite file.
Plus, google sheets works everywhere!
So, to get started, the official way to do this is from the google developers website.
https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts
It is not so easy to understand for a beginner(which I am).</description>

      <description>Today the coding calendar Advent of Code started.
You should try it too, Advent of Code.
I tried to solve the first challenge. It was pretty straight forward. Except, I was stumped by a simple problem.
Here is my first attempt,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def part1(lines): prev = lines[0] more = 0 for i in range(len(lines) - 1): if lines[i+1] &amp;gt; prev: more += 1 prev = lines[i+1] print(more) if __name__ ==&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;: with open(&amp;#39;.</description>
