Plus, google sheets works everywhere!
So, to get started, the official way to do this is from the google developers website.

It is not so easy to understand for a beginner(which I am).</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://lamichhaneaayush.com.np/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lamichhaneaayush.com.np/about/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AayushðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineering student at Pulchowk.
