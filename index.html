Having worked at two different places, I think the following summarize what I have learnt so far. I can’t say that I have folllowed these, but I have tried to keep them in mind lately, and arranged my thoughts to put these down.
Caring just enough
Right after graduating, I started working at a startup. It was fun, but there were times when it was just too much. I felt like I was always busy with something but not really doing things that mattered. The spotlight for the startup is someone else. Anything you do not is the spotlight is not appreciated. The tasks will always seem endless, and the light at the end of the tunnel is important, even if its a fake one. The trick to be able to working for someone not yourself is to care just enough. Not too much that you are frustrated at the situation, but not too little that you don’t yourself improve. Care too much and you burn out, feel just hatred for the job, the team, their shortcomings, their management, all the things. Care too little and you are not enjoying, you’re bored, you’re underperforming, and you risk getting fired, and no one likes that. Having grit
Over the last two years, I have found that having grit is the one thing that actually gets some work done. There are countless things that are fun to do, that seem productive, that will teach you something new, something you like, but these are things that only you know. Only you know that you’ve read all those articles about eBPF, or Elixir, or Gleam or Terraform or anything else. And you surely learned something new in those articles. But the only thing you can do now is forget. You need to be doing something, you can’t just pretend to learn. You need proof for it to mean something. So, have grit, let go of the fun articles, that new language, that awesome technology, and build something. It is difficult, but it will seem awesome when you’re done later. Investing in tools
It took me way too long to realize this. The tools you learn are yours to keep, forever(at least if you pick your tools carefully). So, master your tools. No one cares how much time you spent on doing a task, so might as well use the tools that make you faster, or make it easier. I have completely shifted to vim and tmux for my terminal needs, and I can’t imagine going back. Along with a host of other tools, docker, ffmpeg, or just git. Can’t imagine how much time I have saved by using simple tools. Your knowledge also keeps accumulating. That library you build today will save you a lot of time some day. I love how people taking part in gamejams create breathtaking games in just a few days. And their secret is that they have stashed their knowledge from regularly tinkering with so many ideas, and their prefabs, libraries that they built over the time they have been learning. So, when its time to build something, they have a solid system. Build systems, not just projects. Build libraries, not just scripts. Build tools, not just code. Having freedom of thought
This one’s pretty simple, have time for reflections. Autopilot is not the way to go. You need to be able to try out things, meet new people or do whatever you find interesting. Plan out what you want to do. Don’t be so invested in someone else’s dream that you forget yours. Life is but an optimization problem, re-adjust your strategy from time to time.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-09-17 23:48:40 +0545 +0545'>September 17, 2025</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Reflections on two years on the industry." href=https://lamichhaneaayush.com.np/posts/reflections-on-two-years/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://lamichhaneaayush.com.np/posts/cloudflare-tunnels/thumbnail.png alt="Failed image loading"></figure><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Cloudflare Tunnels: Expose your local server to the internet.</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>How can you quickly expose your local server to the internet?

Add you domain to Cloudflare and then install the cloudflared tool.

My solution wasn’t getting accepted by maelstrom because there were duplicate Ids generated by my program. After looking at my code for very long and not finding any idea what went wrong, I asked ChatGPT, it suggested the sequenceNumber bits were too few and must probably be overflowing. After looking at the maelstrom logs I found the lines which had duplicate Ids.

Starting items: 91, 65 Operation: new = old * 13 Test: divisible by 5 If true: throw to monkey 7 If false: throw to monkey 4 I had to parse the file to get all values, but when parsing the second line I thought why not use the python interpretor itself. And so, I created a variable called old and whenever it needed updating I would use the following line

It went as smoothly as I had hoped (at first).
So, I ran sudo blkid to find the UUID of the drive I wanted to mount and added the entry UUID=288C1E6C8C1E3532 /hdrive auto defaults 0 0 following the steps in this wonderful article. (Some options are different after I realized what I wanted.)
Article
Then I ran sudo mount -a to check if the mounts were working properly. But here the problem began. The drive was mounted as readonly. There is no mention of readonly mount in the options.
In fact I learnt that defaults option is shorthand for rw (read write) and bunch of other options. Then I tried various mount options and got sick of rebooting. I tried directly mounting as ntfs instead of auto. But it didn’t work.
After lot of struggle I figured out the problem. It was because of my Windows Installation!
I have dual boot setup. And turns out windows stores some files for faster booting (fast boot) in the harddisk thus linux cannot mount the drive cleanly and can only mount it as a read only drive. So to fix this I had to boot to windows and change the fast boot setting. Here’s how,

It is not so easy to understand for a beginner(which I am). So, upon further looking around I came across this wonderful python library that makes things so much easier. It’s gspread.
