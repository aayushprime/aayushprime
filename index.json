[{"content":"Today I found out that Google Chrome has a feature called \u0026ldquo;Secure DNS\u0026rdquo; that allows users to specify a custom DNS provider (also options to choose from popular ones like Cloudflare). Some time ago, I must have turned this on or maybe it was enabled by default.\nToday I was trying to visit callbreak.games and mistakenly went to callbreak.bhoos.games. And what do I see? I was redirected to this random website planet.news. I thought there was a bug somewhere or I downloaded some kind of malware. I tried disabling all the extensions in my Chrome and I was still getting the same redirect happening.\nIn the end I found out that my system DNS was alright. Along the way I found out Chrome has its own internal net log viewer, DNS tools available. I tried everything, recording chrome logs, trying to look at extensions code and one particular extension Control for Instagram was particularly suspicious because if I turned it off the redirect would disappear and if I enabled it, the redirect was there again. (It was a fluke)\nI queried Chrome\u0026rsquo;s DNS (using chrome://net-internals/#dns) and it was showing some random IP address range and it was pointing to the DNS. It was doing some kind of weird thing where it would request some JavaScript from the server and then try to hit an endpoint and if the endpoint responded with 200, then it would redirect me to some another domain which for me was planet.news.\nThe reason for all this is actually really stupid. The Chrome Secure DNS feature is actually not what I would call secure at all. It uses DNS over HTTP and when you query the DNS over HTTP and the DNS response is NXDOMAIN which means it does not actually exist. We can see this in the dig command in the system using the system DNS.\n❯ dig @127.0.2.2 atta.bhoos.games ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.10.6 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; @127.0.2.2 doesntexist.bhoos.games ; (1 server found) ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -\u0026gt;\u0026gt;HEADER\u0026lt;\u0026lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 6013 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;atta.bhoos.games.

But the only thing you can do now is forget. You need to be doing something, you can\u0026rsquo;t just pretend to learn. You need proof for it to mean something. So, have grit, let go of the fun articles, that new language, that awesome technology, and build something. It is difficult, but it will seem awesome when you\u0026rsquo;re done later. Investing in tools\nIt took me way too long to realize this. The tools you learn are yours to keep, forever(at least if you pick your tools carefully). So, master your tools. No one cares how much time you spent on doing a task, so might as well use the tools that make you faster, or make it easier. I have completely shifted to vim and tmux for my terminal needs, and I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine going back. Along with a host of other tools, docker, ffmpeg, or just git.

My solution wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting accepted by maelstrom because there were duplicate Ids generated by my program. After looking at my code for very long and not finding any idea what went wrong, I asked ChatGPT, it suggested the sequenceNumber bits were too few and must probably be overflowing. After looking at the maelstrom logs I found the lines which had duplicate Ids.\nThat was very strange. I noticed all IDs generated ended with 000. Surely, I made a mistake on the bitwise OR of the sequence number, right?\nWrong.\nI figured out how to log to stderr and looked at what my Ids were.\n1 2 id = id | ((s.sequenceNumber \u0026amp; 0xffff) ) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Sequence Number: %d %u %lu\u0026#34;, id, id, id) And they were unique alright. For a second I thought that Golang must be casting my Ids into some other datatype and truncating my IDs. But that was not it. It was maelstrom it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t accept the last 3 digits. I think this is because we\u0026rsquo;re using JSON and while JSON doesn\u0026rsquo;t limit the size of the number in its spec (see here), there might be something in the middle that cannot accept that number and is thus being truncated. NodeJS for example can only process numbers upto\n1 2 3 \u0026gt; Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER 9007199254740991 \u0026gt; So the solution is to just move the sequenceNumber a few bits up as we have plenty of space left in the sequenceNumber space. maelstrom test cases dont generate too many ids in the same millisecond.\n1 id = id | ((s.sequenceNumber \u0026amp; 0xffff) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 10)

The input file had the following structure\nStarting items: 91, 65 Operation: new = old * 13 Test: divisible by 5 If true: throw to monkey 7 If false: throw to monkey 4 I had to parse the file to get all values, but when parsing the second line I thought why not use the python interpretor itself. And so, I created a variable called old and whenever it needed updating I would use the following line\nold = eval( \u0026#34;line 2 after the equal part\u0026#34; ) The clever part was that I was skipping having to translate whatever symbol was present in the input (one of +, - , / or *) This was fine for the test input, but it became slow when I ran it against the larger input.\nI ran python -m cProfile main.py to find out that it was eval that took a bunch of time. It was being invoked a lot of time because it was called in the update loop.\nSo, I thought,\nwhy not store the function into a lambda before hand and then just call the lambda instead of calling eval? And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I did, and it worked. The unoptimized program took about 6 seconds when running on the complete input. But after I stored the operation in a lambda, it was basically instant. So, here is the main \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo;\noperation = eval(\u0026#34;lambda old: \u0026#34; + lines[2].split(\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;)[1].strip()) Notice the parameter name of the lambda \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; it is necessary because the string is \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; in the input.\nSo, why is running eval repeatedly slow?\nEval is used for evaluating dynamic expressions, but we already have a fixed expression, so eval is doing extra work trying to evaluate the same expression many times, if we compile the expression to a lambda, we can just execute a lambda and it is a lot faster.\n","permalink":"https://lamichhaneaayush.com.np/posts/solveeval/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to another one of my interesting findings, where I explore some stuff for fun \u003cdel\u003eand profit\u003c/del\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ejust fun\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA while back I was solving \u003ca href=\"https://adventofcode.com/\"\u003eAOC\u003c/a\u003e and for a problem (day 13), I had this sort of clever idea of using eval to skip writing a \u003ccode\u003eif else\u003c/code\u003e  ladder.\nThe input file had the following structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-Monkey\" data-lang=\"Monkey\"\u003e  Starting items: 91, 65\n  Operation: new = old * 13\n  Test: divisible by 5\n    If true: throw to monkey 7\n    If false: throw to monkey 4\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had to parse the file to get all values, but when parsing the second line I thought why not use the python interpretor itself.
